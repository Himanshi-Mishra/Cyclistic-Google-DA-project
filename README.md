# Cyclistic-Google-Data-Analyst-project

## Project Overview
The marketing director at Cyclistic, a Chicago-based bike-sharing company, has identified an important objective for the company's success: maximizing the number of annual memberships. To achieve this goal, a team has been formed to analyze how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. The team's ultimate objective is to design a new marketing strategy that will encourage more casual riders to become annual members.
